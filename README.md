# Employee Team Builder App

### **Note: completed html file can be found in dist folder.**

## Introduction

For this assignment, I created an Employee team roster through the command line with the npm inquirer package. Also, used npm package Jest for testing the constructor classes.

## Demo

After answering a series of questions in the command line, the data will be pushed to a pre-styled HTML page with boxes for different employee types: Manager, Engineer and Intern.

As you can see, each employee type has slightly different data on it, for example office number, github repo, and school.

The email links are live, so they open a modal for the user to compose an email directly:

For the "Engineer" employee, there is a live github link that goes directly to that employee's github profile which opens in a separate tab in the browser for convenience:

## Challenges

Writing 95% of the code for this project was quite easy, but the last 5%, which is to say, the code for passing the data onto the HTML page proved to be quite challenging. but after a bit of persistence, it became fully functional.


## Future Development

In the future I'd be interested in using a fully front-end user npm to answer questions and generate HTML pages.  While it is rewarding to use the command line to accomplish such tasks, it doesn't seem applicable to a real world app.
